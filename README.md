**Reported By:** Monitoring System (PagerDuty)

**Severity Level:** High

**Status:** Resolved

## Incident Description

The monitoring system triggered an alert indicating that disk usage on the production server `prod-server-02` has exceeded the threshold of 90%. Immediate action was required to prevent potential system issues and data loss.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation

1. **Disk Usage Analysis:** Used the `df -h` and `du -sh /*` commands to identify the filesystem and directories consuming the most disk space.
2. **Log File Review:** Examined log files to identify any unusual activity contributing to increased disk usage.

### Findings

- The root cause of the high disk usage was identified as excessive log file generation by a misconfigured application.
- The application generated large log files without proper log rotation, leading to rapid consumption of disk space.

## Resolution

1. **Log Rotation Configuration:** Implemented log rotation for the application to prevent excessive log file generation.
2. **Clean Up:** Deleted unnecessary log files and temporary files to free up disk space.
3. **Backup and Archive:** Archived old data files to a backup location and removed them from the server.
4. **Monitoring:** Set up additional alerts to notify when disk usage exceeds 80%.

## Preventive Measures

- Implemented log rotation policies for all applications to manage log file generation effectively.
- Scheduled regular disk usage reviews to identify and address potential issues proactively.
- Enhanced monitoring alerts to provide early warning of high disk usage.

## Lessons Learned

- Proper log rotation configuration is crucial to manage log file generation and prevent excessive disk usage.
- Regular disk usage reviews and enhanced monitoring can help identify and address potential issues proactively.

## Recommendations

1. **Log Rotation Policies:** Implement log rotation policies for all applications to manage log file generation effectively.
2. **Regular Disk Usage Reviews:** Schedule regular disk usage reviews to identify and address potential issues proactively.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring alerts to provide early warning of high disk usage.
